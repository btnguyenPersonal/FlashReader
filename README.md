### FlashReader

This App is an efficiency app designed to increase the speed in which people will read. Instead of reading an app the normal way, the FlashReader app lets you have each word flashed at you on a timer, which allows you to read hands-free and also don't have to move your eyes while reading, which increases efficiency and speed of reading.
